# Congratulations on making it this far. Whether you spent only 30 seconds or 4-5 minutes completing task 2, 
# I'm sure you felt annoyed when you had to read through those anonymous action commits to find the lost file.

# So, when you are writing commit messages, please be concise and clear about what you did. It will save everyone a lot of time.

# Let continue with our mission:
# Task 3: Since you have familiarized yourself with the GitHub website, now it's time to move to your local settings to see a more
# realistic usage of Git. Please clone this repo "Traing-fa23" by following the steps in the lecture. Now you please make a new text file
# in your folder, and write a couple sentence about the things you have learn today.
