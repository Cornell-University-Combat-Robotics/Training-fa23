Congratulations on making it this far. Whether you spent only 30 seconds or 4-5 minutes completing task 2, I'm sure you felt annoyed when you had to read through those anonymous action commits to find the lost file.

So, when you are writing commit messages, please be concise and clear about what you did. It will save everyone a lot of time.

Let continue with our mission: <br>
**Task 3:** Since you have familiarized yourself with the GitHub website, now it's time to move to your local settings to see a more realistic usage of Git. Please clone this repo "Traing-fa23" by following the steps in the lecture. Now you please make a new text file named "[YOUR-FIRST-NAME]_thoughts.txt" in the task3 folder, and write a couple sentence about the things you have learn today. <br>

**Note: Please make sure you are making your file inside of the task3 folder not anywhere else

Once you finish editing your file, please add your changes, make a concise and clear commit message, and push your change to the main branch

Once you have successfully pushed your change, you can process to task 4 by read the instruction.md in the task4 directary via VS code or Github website.
