# Task 6: Delete your secret folder

You are so close to the final treasure...<br>
To process to the next step you need to delete the folder with your name on it.

We didn't teach you how to delete a file/folder in git. This is a task for you to google.
The command to delete a file is silently different than a folder, make sure you get the correct command to delete a FOLDER.
Please make sure to only delete your folder. 

Once you delete your folder, make a push and a pull, and you can move to the next step by read the "task7.md"

Make sure you pull before process the task 7.
