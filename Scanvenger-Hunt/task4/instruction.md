Before process further, make sure you pull the changes made by other people first by run [git pull] once.

Please make a new branch with your name, create a copy of the html code of 
index.html in the task4 folder named [YOUR-NAME_website.html], and edit the copy to display your name. Make sure you add your changes, commit and push your changes to your branch. Task 4 is successfully completed after you showed a trainer your "website".

**Note: Please make sure you are making the copy inside of the task4 folder, not anywhere else

I have provide you with the bare-minimum html code. If you know more, and/or want to do more cool stuff, such as using a CSS style sheet for your website, feel free to play around. 

***Important reminder: Don't forget to pull everytime you complete a task.
